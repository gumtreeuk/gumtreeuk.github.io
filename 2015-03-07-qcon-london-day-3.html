			<p>Another year, another <a target="_blank" href="http://qconlondon.com/">QCon</a> in London. Unfortunately this time I&#39;ve only been able to attend the last day (Friday), but at least it&#39;s a day full of microservices-related talks. Microservices are the new kid in the block and raising <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=microservices">a lot of interest</a>. In this post I&#39;ve written a summary of the main point of talks. </p>
<!-- Read more -->

<p>That said, don&#39;t forget the videos will be <a target="_blank" href="http://qconlondon.com/schedule#day-5">online</a> soon. I specially recommend <a target="_blank" href="http://qconlondon.com/presentation/microservices-software-fits-your-head">these</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://qconlondon.com/presentation/no-free-lunch-indeed-three-years-micro-services-soundcloud">three</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://qconlondon.com/presentation/operating-microservices">talks</a> as I found they cover Microservices not only from development point of view, but also from business and operation perspectives which is something we engineers sometimes dismiss a bit.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start!</p>
<h2 id="netflix-built-it-s-own-monitoring-system-and-why-you-shouldn-t">Netflix built it&#39;s own monitoring system - and why you shouldn&#39;t</h2>
<p>The day started with a keynote by Roy Rapoport, Manager of Insight Engineering at Netflix. </p>
<p>His talk revolved around the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a> issue that affects many companies. If you have a problem,you should consider some questions first:</p>
<ul>
<li>are you the first person to have this issue?</li>
<li>are you the first to care about it given your constraints: relevance to business, your scale, etc</li>
<li>are you sure about the above answers?</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases you may really be the first and you may need to build your own solution. But most of the time that is not true as solutions, either paid or free, exist.</p>
<p>There are many to not build your own product: development cost, technical incompatibility, lack of understanding of the domain. This last one is very relevant, as it often happens that people dismissed a solution because &#39;it does too much, it is too complex&#39;. Given a stablished product this answer means that you are not thinking about the problem in the right way, or you lack insight on how will the problem grow in the future.</p>
<p>In the end, NIH is about trust: we don&#39;t trust other people&#39;s code, their product, their organisation, or that they will take good care of us as a customer. Even past performance of a 3rd party in other domains may move the balance towards building our own solution.</p>
<p>If the decision is to build your own product, that&#39;s ok. It is ok to build things for the sake of building things. But usually there is another reason we don&#39;t acknowledge: the glory, reputation, how good will it look in your cv. If that makes the developers happy, go ahead and build your own solution as this is a valid reason with some value. Just acknowledge that is the reason, don&#39;t use bad excuses.</p>
<h2 id="microservices-software-that-fits-in-your-head">Microservices: Software that fits in your head</h2>
<p>Dan North, of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> fame, tried to define what is a Microservice.</p>
<p>As an introduction he started by trying to define the goal of software development, which he considers to be &#39;to sustainably minimise lead time to business impact&#39;. And doing this sustainably is hard, but that is the ultimate goal. Thus we want effective development, which is not the same as productive development. We don&#39;t care about code, but about the business impact.</p>
<p>That is to mean that the code is not an asset, is a cost we assume to obtain the business impact. Writing code, changing code, and understanding code; they are all costs. For example, when we talk about understanding code we find 3 types of code:</p>
<ul>
<li>code I know because it&#39;s either recent or I wrote it</li>
<li>code everyone knows because it is well tested, documented, etc</li>
<li>code nobody knows, it happens to be there but it is not well tested nor documented, no one understand it completely. This is bad as it has a high cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence we want to stabilise our code or, alternatively, kill it fast and replace it by less-costly code. As it happens, the patterns that facilitate this process lead to Microservices. </p>
<p>The first <em>pattern</em> is to have a short software <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life">half-life</a>. An application can be long lived, but the code that composes that application may not be. Effective teams tend to have a very short code half-life, in which after a few weeks the code has changed a lot and whole sections have been replaced or moved. This keeps the costs associated to code low.</p>
<p>To facilitate a short half-life we want to write discrete components, with clear boundaries, and clear purpose and responsibility. The boundaries happen at many levels: deployment (containers), design (DDD), etc. A clear purpose reduces uncertainty. </p>
<p>A good strategy to achieve this reduced half-life is to let code self-select. Once a piece of code has been sticking around for a while, complete it with more tests and documentation. Choose the code in which you invest, and let the remaining code die.</p>
<p>Another <em>pattern</em> is to consider anything that doesn&#39;t fit in your head as too big. Fitting in your head happens on several dimensions: the domain of the problem, the technology stack, etc. Also at multiple scales: a function, a module, the service, the whole app.</p>
<p>What we need to achieve is contextual consistency: given a context we are likely to make similar decisions, so try to create this common context (idioms, default choices). Any differences that arise are useful data points, as they may happen due to miscommunication, a reasonable choice or a need to kill some code, and we need to understand why we have that difference. Just remember that familiar doesn&#39;t mean simple.</p>
<p>The aim is to obtain a sustainable replaceable component architecture, in which we have a lot of small components wrapped in a hard shell (their API), which we can rebuild easily. Given this, our functional, integration, and unit tests collapse into the same thing as we can fake the interactions (and avoid mocks in the process, mocks are evil).</p>
<p>This maps perfectly with &#39;little computers passing messages&#39;, which was the original definition of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>. We have services/containers (little computers) sending messages across. We got it wrong the first time!</p>
<p>A Microservice can be a type of replaceable component architecture, if you optimise for replaceability and consistency. Don&#39;t optimise for size, smaller is not necessarily better, more replaceable is better. And kill code fearlessly.</p>
<h2 id="microservices-are-too-conceptually-big">Microservices are too (conceptually) big</h2>
<p>In this talk, Philip Wills, Senior Software Architect at The Guardian, explains how The Guardian moved from a monolith to Microservices. Currently they release around 40 different services to production each week.</p>
<p>When they were a monolith they started to find some problems. For example, after a hackathon they realised they could not integrate some of the things they developed into their monolith as it was too expensive, too hard. There was a lot of inherent complexity, so much that at some point they had 1 person working full time as release manager to coordinate bi-weekly releases.</p>
<p>They also had a concern with limiting the scope of failure. The monolith allowed embedding some <em>microapps</em> into specific places, but they hit performance and coupling issues soon enough. It also meant it was not easy to remove dead services, as the high coupling made hard to understand the implications of removing code.</p>
<p>So they moved to single responsibility apps, focussed on resilience and with limited scope (you can fit it in your head). To preserve each one as an independent product they try to move away from Json (due to its lack of strong typing) and ensuring their API is fully backwards compatible, so no coordination is required when you do a new release.</p>
<p>An important point he raised is that they try to avoid sharing libraries across services, due to the amount of contention they cause. They consider this a last resort.</p>
<h2 id="protocols-of-interaction-best-current-practices">Protocols of interaction: best current practices</h2>
<p>Todd Montgomery gave a talk looking at a lower level than usual. When talking about Microservices people usually think on architecture, he want down to protocol implementation details to explain their impact when building Microservices.</p>
<p>Protocol definition matters. Protocols not only define how we format and treat data, they also define how do we interact with something. Protocols of interaction matter much more now that we are embracing Microservices, and they are a great solution for many of the problems raised by them. Internet (in fact, any network) is an hostile environment were data can be lost, duplicated, reordered, etc. And TCP is not a safeguard from those issues. They <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">will happen</a>.</p>
<p>Todd described many of the issues we find int he network and solutions we can apply. I feel a partial explanation would we bad as the details matter, so I&#39;d recommend you to <a target="_blank" href="http://qconlondon.com/presentation/protocols-interaction-best-current-practices">watch the video</a> once it is released.</p>
<p>The main takeaway of the talk: Protocols are a rich source of solutions to complicated problems.</p>
<h2 id="no-free-lunch-indeed-three-years-of-microservices-at-soundcloud">No free lunch, indeed: three years of Microservices at SoundCloud</h2>
<p>This talk by the Director of Core Engineering at Soundcloud, Phil Caldado, explained how SoundCloud adopted microservices before many of the tools we have today existed. SoundCloud currently serves 300M users each month and uploads more than 11h of music each minute. </p>
<p>SoundCloud moved from a <a target="_blank" href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SacrificialArchitecture.html">Sacrificial Architecture</a> to Microservices. They predicted they would have a massive growth in Microservices and needed to prepare to be able to manage it correctly. </p>
<p>Before you can start with Microservices, you need 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>rapid provisioning of servers (or containers or vm&#39;s)</li>
<li>basic monitoring</li>
<li>rapid app deployment with a short turnaround</li>
</ul>
<p>For <em>provisioning</em>, SoundCloud moved from AWS to their own datacenter in Amsterdam, although they still use S3 and some other Amazon services. The model in 2011 was Heroku and they tried to replicate the experience via tools like Doozer, Lxc and 12-factor app guidelines. The problem is that their naive approach along a lack of resource limitation meant they became their own &#39;loud neighbour&#39; inside their own datacenter. </p>
<p>They had also built an architecture aiming to use Ruby and Node.js while now they work with the JVM (Clojure, Scala). Also, at that time Mesos, Aurora and Docker didn&#39;t exist, they have appeared later while they were still working in their v1 release. Currently they are using <a target="_blank" href="https://tumblr.github.io/collins/">Collins</a> for provisioning, which is not a final solution but it will buy time until they can stabilise things.</p>
<p>On <em>telemetry</em> they found a similar issue: the tools available at 2011 weren&#39;t great. The common tooling was a push model based on StatsD, Graphite and Nagios. Engineers they hired at that time wanted a pull model so they developed <a target="_blank" href="http://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> which works along <a target="_blank" href="https://www.icinga.org/">Icinga</a> to provide better data. </p>
<p>When they moved to Microservices their monitoring didn&#39;t break. To facilitate finding root problems they standardised the dashboards so each service gives the same information with the same scales, avoiding common mistakes when reading graphs. They also build a template (similar to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/twitter/twitter-server">TwitterServer</a>) so all services provide an admin interface that can help do things like trigger a circuit breaker or shutdown a service, to speed up crisis resolution. They also send 0.1% of their traffic to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/twitter/zipkin">Zipkin</a> to trace requests. That amount of traffic is enough to detect any issues.</p>
<p>Most importantly, management lines are all in the notification system so a pager alert will wake up everybody, making them more aware of the issues.</p>
<p>Regarding their <em>pipeline</em> at the beginning they had 2 different pipelines: one for build, one for release. Customisation and other factors ended up creating 7 different deployment scripts. Currently they use Docker to run tests when in development. Jenkins takes care of building and packaging the application as a deb package, and they use that for deployment. They have not adopted Docker yet as they don&#39;t want a strong coupling.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-modern-microservices-architecture-at-gilt-the-essentials">Building a modern Microservices architecture at Gilt: the essentials</h2>
<p>Yoni Goldberg, Lead Software Engineer at Gilt, explained the Gilt moved from a Ruby monolith to a Microservices approach. The reason was that Gilt operates a model of flash sales with massive spikes, and adding certain vendor caused cascading errors across the site. To fix the issues they moved to JVM, started what he calls a macro/micro services era and used dedicated data stores. </p>
<p>During the process they realised the new services where semi-monoliths, not fixing all of the issues, so they kept working until they reduced the scope of the services (both for back-end and front-end, they have multiple webapps for UI), which in turn facilitated deployment and rollbacks.</p>
<p>Currently they have 300 services in production, and their data show a very interesting pattern: once they had in place all the right tools such a team could go from creation to deployment of a new service (a basic placeholder) in around 10 minutes, the productivity and the number of services increased a lot.</p>
<p>The process wasn&#39;t seamless, they had to solve several challenges in areas like monitoring, ownership, service discoverability, deplyment and testing, etc. </p>
<p>Some of the challenges have been solved by using custom tooling, with many libraries they created available as <a target="_blank" href="http://code.gilt.com/">open source</a>. For example, they created some enhanced Sbt which included plugins they commonly use plus some custom commands to deploy to production, thus replacing an old Capistrano-based system. Another of their tools, Ion Cannon, facilitates testing and deployment to production using a dark canary pattern. An another is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cavellc.io/">Cave LLC</a>, a metrics system.</p>
<p>The situation at this point still wasn&#39;t optimal as they hit data centre limitations. This encouraged them to move to an immutable infrastructure based on Docker and Elastic BeanStalk. They also gave each team their own AWS account and budget. As a result, teams are accountable for the resources they use and optimise as required. The (possible) downside is the need to know more about AWS and slightly longer deploys due to machine start up time.</p>
<p>Something that has facilitated the adoption of Microservices has been a well defined API. Yoni argues that a well defined API solves issues like discoverability, documentation and internal adoption. Tools like Swagger facilitate this.</p>
<p>An issue associated to having so many Microservices that is not mentioned often is that the network ends up acting as a bottleneck, due to the amount of calls generated. Their solution is to create mid-tier Microservices, which are a <em>coarse API</em> that hides multiple small services from the request. Your application just calls an endpoint and that, in turn, does several calls. This reduces the load, even more if you use caching. </p>
<p>Another issue is that developer&#39;s hardware can&#39;t cope with so many services running locally. The solution they have is not ideal, but they use an AWS pool as integration instances and developers can connect to them. Also related to the development of services are the concerns about knowledge sharing. Gilt&#39;s approach is to code review everything, this way the knowledge is spread across the team and not hoarded by individuals.</p>
<p>Gilt also uses micro-databases, that is, every Microservice has its own database, they are not shared across services. This means the service owns everything: API, data, behaviour. No conflicts between services due to shared databases.</p>
<p>Finally, they don&#39;t advise teams of less than 30 people to go into Microservices due to the manpower needed.</p>
<h2 id="operating-microservices">Operating Microservices</h2>
<p>The last talk of the day. Michael Brunton-Spall, Technical Architect at the Government Digital Service, delivered a talk full of energy about Microservices from the point of view of Operations.</p>
<p>He started by letting us know his talk applied to Microservices understood as &#39;vertically aligned stacks that communicate via simple and standard interfaces&#39;. In this context ownership of data matters, you don&#39;t want to share data. Teams own the code, people outside the team don&#39;t modify that code. Teams also own the runtime, they choose what they want to use, even Erlang in a supposedly JVM shop. If your Microservices don&#39;t fit the above definitions, you are doing it wrong and this talk won&#39;t help you at all.</p>
<p>Microservices are <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway&#39;s Law</a>. Management and developers love them because:</p>
<ul>
<li>small owned services that can be updated more often</li>
<li>teams can move fast and break stuff</li>
<li>teams can own the whole stack</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand infrastructure teams hate them because:</p>
<ul>
<li>small owned services that can be updated more often. But changing things breaks things.</li>
<li>teams can move fast and break stuff. Ops want to be slow and stable, avoid breaking things</li>
<li>teams can own the whole stack. Ops are not required, thus they lose control over security</li>
</ul>
<p>@JeffSussna said that Microservices are a new organisational model as much as a new architecture model, and we need to understand this before using them. Microservices can help you have a radical focus on delivery, and they are not even a new architecture as Internet itself uses that pattern (small boxes talking to each other each one doing one thing). You need that speed as nowadays is not the big fish that eats the small, is the fast that eats the slow. But operations team are perceived like a bottleneck and, in the end, perception is reality. </p>
<p>So you need Microservices, and a way to manage the change that is happening in the role of engineering and operations.</p>
<p>The best starting point it to just run 1 Microservice, by itself, successfully. Microservices in the small. You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure you are able to do it</li>
<li>automate your infrastructure (use of containers is not necessary)</li>
<li>create a base image for your service</li>
<li>deploy it fast, with a time-to-server of a few minutes, not hours</li>
</ul>
<p>During this process you will learn some stuff. For example, some bugs that were critical before (out of ram) become irrelevant when your service is automatically restarted in less than one minute if the server crashes. Yes, you may want to fix it, but it won&#39;t wake up anyone at 2am.</p>
<p>You need monitoring tools that are easy to hook into. If it moves, you want to graph it. If it doesn&#39;t too, just in case it starts moving. You also need automated log aggregation (logstash, kibana). And cloud-friendly databases, otherwise when the database server goes down (and in the cloud it happens, often) your data may be lost.</p>
<p>You must automate your deployment. It doesn&#39;t need to be complex, it can be as simple as executing a self-contained Jetty, but keep a log of the deploys done including the commits that were released. And you must give the keys to the development team, as well as root. And give them pagers too: if they break it, they fix it. But to do that they need full access.</p>
<p>All the above are solved problems, the tools exist. Follow the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: use the existing tools and focus your effort in business value.</p>
<p>At this point point you have 1 Microservice running. Now repeated to get 10, 100, ... Microservices in the large.</p>
<p>When you have many services running, they are going to fail in more spectacular ways than their equivalent monoliths. They are not complicated (like a car), but complex (like a traffic system) in which the root cause may be distant in time and space.</p>
<p>Due to that, diagnosis tools are a must. On each single service. You need both shallow check that ensure it is working, and deep checks that ensure its dependencies are working. Also for the 90, 95 and 99 percentiles. This will help you find the source of a problem and detect issues as they start to creep in.</p>
<p>Any distributed system needs to embrace failure. You have network partitions, latency spikes, etc. Timeouts can be problematic, use with care. Standardised administration interfaces and alerting tools may help mitigate the consequences. </p>
<p>Also, what happens when developers get bored of the service? Developers are always building a future legacy service. How do you manage the handover? Who pays for the support of that service? In the end, Conway&#39;s Law is not about engineering teams, but about the full organisation. It affects the budget, SLAs, recruitment needs and other factors. </p>
<p>So, as a result, Operation teams should act as consultants. Anything developers need which is new has an additional front cost to be paid before the green light: automation and documentation. This way the pioneer pays the cost and the rest of the team benefits from it. While Ops keeps some control.</p>
