			<p>On the 16th and 17th October 2014 I attended the Big Data &amp; Analytics Innovation Summit in London, hosted by Innovation Enterprise. There were 18 different speakers each with a 30 minute presentation-slot.
<!-- Read more --></p>
<p>The talks focused on a range of different areas where big data is concerned. Some presenters were technologists, some were data analysts, some were company directors. The different talks on big data can roughly be categorised into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection</li>
<li>Aggregation framework</li>
<li>Tools for analysis</li>
<li>Effective use of results</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-best-talks">The best talks</h2>
<p>I could go through the 9 pages of notes I made which covered every talk, however that would make a rather long blog post. Instead I will concentrate on a few that stood out for me.</p>
<h3 id="expedia">Expedia</h3>
<p>As a technologist, my personal favourite talk was on the first morning by Andrea Eakin, Tech Lead at Expedia. She described how there are 1 trillion route possibilities for a flight from New York to London, and Expedia gets 60 million unique users per month. Previously all of this data - and it was from a variety of sources - was aggregated by a rather cumbersome batch process. Data would take between 1-3 days to process and this of course made many things very difficult - A/B test results couldn&#39;t be found quickly enough, the health of the data was impossible to monitor and fix in time.</p>
<p>Part of the solution was to unify the data sources into expanded web logs, and feed this into a Storm cluster via Kestrel MQ. Aggregated data would be held in a PostgreSql database with a bunch of triggers and another Storm cluster behind it. The dashboard for results would then query Postgres. After this phase 1, they found however that Postgres was rather slow to perform lookups and do calculations. Dynamo DB was chosen to provide a simple key/value store for the calculation results, then as the team&#39;s knowledge of Storm grew more of the Postgres trigger logic was moved there instead. What they have now is a much better &#39;realtime&#39; processing architecture which allows for faster feedback, fault tolerance, and healthier data.</p>
<h3 id="badoo">Badoo</h3>
<p>Probably the highlight of day 1 for most people was the afternoon talk by Edward Kibardin, of Badoo. He has his own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.datarefiner.com">framework</a> (can I call it that?) which produces topological/diagrammatical analysis of large datasets.</p>
<p>One example he gave was, say you are Netflix and you have a large table describing which users have watched which movies. Using the data refiner tool it is possible to produce a network where each node is a movie and the links between them represent users who watched both. The more users who watched both, the stronger the link. From this as well the tool can group strongly-linked movies into clusters, and these might roughly equate to genres. It is then possible to see which users prefer which genres, which genres are closely linked together, and so on.</p>
<p>Being a social network, Badoo has a number of similar concerns to Gumtree, so this was very interesting for us. Using the Data Refiner they are able to get help on a wide range of business problems - in particular trust and safety.</p>
<h3 id="king-com">King.com</h3>
<p>The first talk on the second morning was by Vince Darley, of King.com (they make Candy Crush Saga and similar famous games, in case you weren&#39;t sure where you&#39;d heard of them). Their Big Data platform is centred around predictive analytics for player behaviour. They have 2 Petabytes of player data, and this is all stored in Hadoop. Initially they were using the classic Hive for ETL to analyse the data, however over time they found this to be too slow, so they have introduced <a target="_blank" href="http://www.exasol.com/en/">ExaSolution</a> which works alongside Hive in a hybrid architecture. This has helped them a lot as their data can now be crunched in 1 hour.</p>
<p>This platform is doing everything in a batch way, solving the realtime challenge is a bridge they are still crossing. What they have learnt from using ExaSol so far is that it could be a good possibility for realtime processing, and they are also looking at Kafka to feed data in.</p>
<h3 id="twitter">Twitter</h3>
<p>Straight after Vince was Anirudh Todi of Twitter. Some readers will already be familiar with the range of open source big data technologies that Twitter have blessed us with, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/twitter/scalding">Scalding</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm">Storm</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/twitter/summingbird">Summingbird</a>.</p>
<p>Scalding is built for traditional batch aggregation in Hadoop, and is a library that allows Hadoop Map-Reduce jobs to be written in Scala.</p>
<p>Storm is a powerful distributed realtime aggregation system, that allows users to design their own topology of &#39;spouts&#39; and &#39;bolts&#39; for realtime computation.</p>
<p>Summingbird is an interface to both, allowing you to write an aggregation job once and it will be converted to both a Scalding version and a Storm version.</p>
<p>This gives rise to a Lambda architecture, where each event to be aggregated is processed twice, once by the batch system and once by the realtime system. What the user sees as the end result is a combination of the results of both systems.</p>
<p>Twitter have built their own wrapper around all of this, called <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/tsar-a-timeseries-aggregator">Tsar - TimeSeries Aggregator</a>. However Tsar is currently quite tied to Twitter&#39;s implementation and business model, so as such it is not open source itself (even though it wraps around all the aforementioned open source technologies).</p>
<h2 id="main-lessons-in-conclusion">Main lessons in conclusion</h2>
<p>This is more a collection of random things I wrote down during the talks that seemed important.</p>
<p>Presenting analysis results to business/stakeholders is hard to get right. It takes more effort to say less, using the dashboard analogy people engage when they are able to digest the key information without any brain power. If you&#39;re writing reports rather than a dashboard, structure it like a news report with a headline.</p>
<p>Many businesses face the &#39;cold start&#39; problem - that is, how do you recommend things to brand new users who have no history with you? You can only go off their registration data and/or info about their device/location. Sometimes that is enough.</p>
<p>If you rely on &#39;local experts&#39; to drive your product you could end up with a <a target="_blank" href="http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer">&#39;Homer&#39;</a>. Companies are slowly realising that they need to be more data driven, and by that it means using your customer&#39;s behaviour to define where you should go next.</p>
<p>One challenge faced though is, once you build a big data tool that crunches numbers, and this replaces an &#39;old way&#39; that your company used previously, how do you make it easy for your analysts to start using it? Hand-offs are not the answer, nor is having one expert analyst to do everything. Sometimes you need big data to analyse the success of your big data system, by tracking the behaviour of your analysts. Sometimes it seems most sensible to produce a user interface that appears the same as the old way - one such example in use was actually a Microsoft Excel interface that performed aggregations in the background.</p>
<p>Technology-wise there are many open-source and even enterprise solutions out there, but use the right tool for the right job and let things evolve, much like your company&#39;s product. </p>
<p>A/B testing does have some caveats, especially where revenue is concerned - what if your A/B test was for total revenue, but only a small percentage of your users are spending money?</p>
