			<p>And it&#39;s over! After an intense week, Gumtree&#39;s Hackathon 2014 ended last Friday. People from all over the business voted with their feet (literally!) and two very interesting projects shared the victory.</p>
<p>But before we rush to the end, let’s explain how we organised and run this event.
<!-- Read more --></p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>To be honest, this was the second time that we tried to run a hackathon this year. Initially scheduled for August, our <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.gumtree.com/see-the-new-gumtree/">responsive</a> project got into its final, critical stages and management decided to delay the event a few weeks. Given the amazing feedback we have been receiving about the new site, it was the right decision :)</p>
<p>So, how did we prepare for this Hackathon? The first step was to agree on how long it should be. There&#39;s plenty of Hackathons which only last 24-48 hours, where the teams pull an all-nighter trying to squeeze out every single bit of functionality from an idea. And they can be fun! But sleep deprivation is <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_sleep_deprivation_on_cognitive_performance">not a good idea</a> and, besides, 2 days may not be enough for some projects. So Gumtree decided to run the hack for a full week.</p>
<p>Coordinating an event like this within our team (30-ish developers) is not easy, less so when you include holidays. We created a doodle with possible dates in which we could do the hackathon, and after a period of voting we chose the best week where the majority could participate. We are sorry for those who couldn&#39;t join us, but hopefully they will be available for the next one.</p>
<p>At this stage, knowing the week and who was available, all we needed were ideas. Enter <a target="_blank" href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, a tool we use a lot, and a great fit for this task. We created a board with several lists, each list representing a facet of the business (SEO, revenue or search were some examples, and there were several lists). Each person with an idea would add a card with the title of the project and a description. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/oblackwood13">Oliver Blackwood</a> helped to streamline this process by running a SurveyMonkey poll (and adding its results to Trello) to ensure people not belonging to the technical team had their say.</p>
<p>With the Trello board full of proposals (more than 40 in total) we started a period in which everybody could vote for the ideas they liked the most. After the voting was over, we organised teams around the most popular ones and ended up with 8 different teams. Then, the week could start.</p>
<h2 id="hackathon-2014-starts-">Hackathon 2014 starts!</h2>
<p>On the first day of the hackathon, teams were mostly ready, although some people had been on holidays during the project discussion and we had a couple of new starters (what a way to join the company!), so we organised a quick meeting to assign any stragglers. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.krispykreme.co.uk/">Krispy Kreme</a> made an appearance to provide sugary fuel for the developers, and the hackathon started, at last.</p>
<p>There&#39;s not much to say from the week itself. Teams self-organised, handing QA environments to each other as was necessary, and everything ran pretty smoothly. Even although we were in the hackathon, there was always time to fix a couple of issues on the site (nothing serious). We also had a few company events in the middle, including the visit from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebayclassifiedsgroup.com/">ECG</a> management team, nothing that would distract us, though.</p>
<h2 id="time-to-shine">Time to Shine</h2>
<p>After a week of planning and coding the hardest part started: demo time! The whole of Gumtree, both the technology and commercial teams, came together to see the results. Each team was allocated a time-slot and they showed what they had built to the company.</p>
<p>The presence of non-technical people already makes communicating the details of what you have done slightly harder (if you want them to appreciate the technical prowess of your team), but to make it more exciting we added an extra challenge in the form of ‘issues’ with both network connectivity and screen resolution on the projector. You know, to make the demo more &#39;interesting&#39;.</p>
<h2 id="the-winners">The Winners</h2>
<p>To decide the winners, we positioned the teams across the room and we asked people to move near the team who presented their favourite project. As we said, people were literally voting with their feet.</p>
<p>It was a close vote, and in the end we had two winners, one for a project about a ‘Gumtree Inbox’ and one which looked at helping the safety of our users. All projects deserved great merit, and the teams displayed great skill in ensuring a bunch of fully functioning solutions in less than 5 days. </p>
<p>The winning teams won a dinner at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gauchorestaurants.co.uk/restaurants/restaurant.php?id=richmond">Gaucho Richmond</a> plus bragging rights, which are worth a lot by themselves!</p>
<p>But more importantly, the winner&#39;s projects have since been added to the Product roadmap. Because of this goal, teams made a conscious effort to produce high-quality code instead of the standard &#39;hackathon-style&#39; code you can see sometimes. It may still need some polish, but not a full rewrite. If you are a developer, you understand how impressive this is when you factor in time constraints and the end results.</p>
<p>And thus, the week ended. It has been an extremely fun event, and we are already thinking on when to organise the next one. Given the sheer amount of great ideas the team proposed and the final results, we’re sure that management are as eager as we are ;)</p>
