			<p>In October I attended the last of the three-day JAX London 2014 Conference. In this post, I will briefly write about the talks that took place in the main room (the Auditorium) and share the links to the speakers&#39; material.
<!-- Read more --></p>
<p>The day started with Chris Richardson&#39;s keynote on <strong>Developing applications with a micro-service architecture</strong>. In this talk Chris gave us some good insight on what constitutes a good micro-services approach without getting lost in a bunch of components.</p>
<p>If the monolithic world may sometimes be simpler to develop and deploy, it can be challenging to include new technologies and scale. Microservices on the other hand, push development to a modular, polyglot architecture where technologies can be chosen in accordance to the problem in hand.
It seems a very good idea, but it increases dramatically the complexity of development and that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>To tackle this inconvenience, Chris presented some strategies. We could work with two basic layers: the service layer (the internal architecture of each service) and the system layer (that acts as an inter-service glue).
This includes the usage of the Single Responsibility Principle (taking special care not to end up with too many services and a potential risk of excessive network hops) and the usage of the API gateway as a single entry point between front-end and back-end.
He also encouraged the use of service deployment options with tools like Docker.</p>
<p>Amongst the real life examples of success he presented an interesting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.addsimplicity.com/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf"><strong>eBay post</strong></a> that is worth reading.</p>
<p>It is always good to be able to get a glimpse of  what people like Chris - with tons of experience - think and do on the matter. If you are curious, the material to his keynote can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/chris.e.richardson/jaxlondon-keynote-developing-applications-with-a-microservice-architecture"><strong>here</strong></a>.
<!-- Read more --></p>
<p>He returned to the auditorium a bit later for a second talk, <strong>Building microservices with Scala, functional domain models and Spring Boot</strong>, in which he went into a bit more detail on microservices architecture combined with a functional and event oriented approach.</p>
<p>In this talk he demonstrated, through a simplified banking application scenario, that event sourcing can solve key data consistency problems when dealing with a micro-service architecture and partitioned or NoSQL databases. He also demonstrated that Spring and Scala can work very well together and that Spring Boot can be a valuable tool to build microservices for a production environment.</p>
<p>If you are interested in working with a similar tech stack, I definitely recommend that you take a look at his material <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/chris.e.richardson/jaxlondon-building-microservices-with-scala-functional-domain-models-and-spring-boot"><strong>here</strong></a>.
<!-- Read more --></p>
<p>The day also had Samir Talwar&#39;s talk on <strong>Design Patterns in the 21st Century</strong>.
Samir started his talk by asking us to stop using Design Patterns. But before any of us had a heart attack, he explained himself: &quot;we should stop doing it as if it was 1999&quot;.</p>
<p>With the advent of lambda expressions in Java 8, we now have a powerful tool that allow us to get rid of the verbosity of inner classes in cases where just a function would be a lot simpler to deal with.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re new to lambda expressions, the most basic and general idea is that, code that once was written like this:</p>
<p><img src="./jax-london-2014/p1.png" alt="Lambda" title="Lambda"></p>
<p>can now be written like this:</p>
<p><img src="./jax-london-2014/p2.png" alt="Lambda" title="Lambda"></p>
<p>GoF&#39;s Design Patterns was written in order to be a catalogue of good solutions to well known problems in development. The efficient idioms they&#39;ve proposed were successfully used in various languages for many years.</p>
<p>Samir walked us through three of the extensive collection of these patterns, one of each category: AbstractFactory from the creational collection of patterns, Adapter from the structural collection and the Chain of Responsibility pattern from the behavioural list.</p>
<p>You can check Samir&#39;s complete talk <a target="_blank" href="http://talks.samirtalwar.com/design-patterns-in-the-21st-century.html"><strong>here</strong></a>, if you&#39;d like to go through each of his examples.
You&#39;ll see that we can indeed improve the writing of design patterns by approaching them with a functional mindset. In the end, the main gain may not necessarily be how many lines of code you end up with, but the possibility to concentrate more on our domain and less on language-implementation details.

<p>The auditorium was also the stage for Sandro Mancuso&#39;s <strong>Crafted Design</strong> talk.
Mancuso talked about the feeling that many (if not all) of us have experienced when joining a new company. As soon as we have our IDE configured and have the chance to take a look at the code we&#39;ll be working on, we start looking through the files trying to figure out what the application is about and, of course,  where to place a new feature.</p>
<p>More often than not we find ourselves staring at packages with names that tell us very little about what the application actually does. We can figure out a few things like &quot;it is a web application with MVC pattern&quot; but a good package structure could actually give us a lot more information than that.</p>
<p>As Mancuso says, we&#39;ve been using MVC but not necessarily in a good way. In his own words, many applications end up with &quot;an anemic domain, flat controllers and strictly coupled to a MVC framework&quot;.</p>
<p>He shares with us his view of what a good MVC application is and how DDD with minor changes can solve this for good. More about his ideas can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sandromancuso/crafted-design-geecon-2014"><strong>here</strong></a>.

<p>The last talk was Richard Warburton&#39;s <strong>Performance from Predictability</strong>.</p>
<p>The author of  the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1449370772/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1449370772&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=insiglogic-21"><em>Java 8 Lambdas book</em></a> did not talk about lambdas this time.
Instead, he demonstrated that a bit of low level knowledge in CPU branch prediction, memory access and storage can help us to improve our application&#39;s performance.</p>
<p>As he said, &quot;performance is not solved only with product solutions (a framework, library or tool) or purely by an adequate architecture. It can actually be accomplished with the help of some methodologies and fundamentals&quot;.</p>
<p>The general idea is that we can, while coding, make some choices that will improve the way CPU branch prediction works, as well as the way memory (both CPU&#39;s cache levels and hard disk) is accessed.</p>
<p>Since CPUs are super-pipelined and superscalar and branching causes stalls (which kills performance), we should simplify our code.
Some of the things that we can do, for instance, is to use smaller data types, avoid &quot;big holes&quot; in our data and make access as linear as possible when performance is an issue.</p>
<p>He pointed that, being able to measure for cache hit/miss rates and correlate that with other data we have can be very helpful. As hard-disk access will always be slower than L1, L2 and L3 caches, when performance is an issue, we  could benefit from simple, sequential memory access patterns and always have in mind that fragmentation is our enemy.</p>
<p>He finished his talk stating that we should generally prefer principles over tools (gather knowledge and apply them to your problems/reality instead of relying on a tool to solve your issues), chose simplicity over complexity and ensure that we use predictable access over random access whenever possible.</p>
<p>His talk&#39;s slides can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/RichardWarburton/performance-and-predictability-1"><strong>here</strong></a>.

<p>The closing keynote was given by Markus Voelter.
His talk, entitled <strong>Introducing Language-Oriented Business Applications</strong>, was about how to allow domain experts (banking, insurance, travelling, etc.) to manipulate their data without help from developers.</p>
<p>In other words, it was about the idea that domain-specific languages (DSLs) can enable domain experts to program what they need without having to rely on a complex system that only developers can understand and evolve.</p>
<p>The idea is not by any means new but, as IDEs are now more powerful than ever, they can actually be used as a platform for the creation and usage of language-oriented business applications.</p>
<p>During his talk he showed us some examples of what can be accomplished with the tools available nowadays.
I couldn&#39;t find the slides used in this particular talk, but more information can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/schogglad"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
