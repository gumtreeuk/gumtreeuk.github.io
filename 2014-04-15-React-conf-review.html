			<p>One week has gone since the end of <a target="_blank" href="http://reactconf.com/">React.conf</a> talks. The videos are being released <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/reactconf/videos">in this Youtube channel</a>. In the meantime you can check the notes we took on <a target="_blank" href="./2014-04-08-React-conf-day-1.html">day 1</a> and <a target="_blank" href="./2014-04-08-React-conf-day-2.html">day 2</a>. </p>
<!-- Read more -->

<p>The event was great. There were some areas that can be improved (chairs, venue size and distribution) but I met great people, and listening to the speakers sharing their expertise was very useful. the only downside is the amount of time I may need to process all that information! </p>
<p>That said, I think not all talks were at the same level, it felt like if there were 3 tiers of talks: amazing, good and the rest. I want to revisit the talks and add my personal comments on them. You may disagree, comments are open below for that ;)</p>
<h2 id="reactive-service-levels">Reactive Service Levels</h2>
<p>Let me start by this talk by <em>Ben Christensen</em> (@benjchristensen) from Netflix. If I had to choose only one talk from the event, this would be it. </p>
<p>Ben did a great job speaking, but the most impressive part was seeing the way Netflix works behind the curtain. Some things have been talked about before (the Simian army) but getting to know the way they use real traffic for testing or their release process was very interesting. Obviously Netflix works at a massive scale and not all companies need all those tools, but enlightening anyway.</p>
<h2 id="-reactive-design-language-and-paradigms">(Reactive) Design, Language, and Paradigms</h2>
<p>This talk by <em>Dean Wampler</em> (@deanwamplerr) was the first of the second day. </p>
<p>He analysed several paradigms and how well they resonated with Reactive concepts. His claims on DDD were surprising giving all the effort you can see online towards integrating actors and DDD, but the explanations made quite a lot of sense. An interesting theoretical exercise.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-reactive-">What does it mean to be Reactive?</h2>
<p>The first talk of the event, by <em>Erik Meijer</em> (@headinthebox). Very funny and totally worth watching, he surprised by requesting we kill reactive (the word) due to the danger of it becoming just a buzzword.</p>
<p>During the talk he explained how getters and setters are equivalent to Observables and Enumerators without a correct signature. He also made us aware on how many method definitions are incorrect as they don&#39;t make some issues explicit, like latency (Futures) or empty values (Option).</p>
<h2 id="responsive-trait-responding-in-a-timely-manner-">Responsive Trait - Responding in a Timely Manner.</h2>
<p>A talk by <em>Martin Thompson</em> (@mjpt777). I found it eye opening as he went over common performance issues companies find on the wild and that, at first, seem to contradict &#39;common assumptions&#39; about how they don&#39;t really improve performance (wrong, as he explained). </p>
<p>The main point across the talk was that we are too isolated from the lower layers, but that means that we live a lie as we are all dependent on the details.</p>
<h2 id="stuff-i-learned-building-reactive-systems">Stuff I learned building reactive systems</h2>
<p><em>Joe Armstrong</em> (@joeerl), principal inventor of Erlang, gave this talk focused on protocols and implementation. </p>
<p>He covered core concepts that shaped Erlang and any kind of reactive system. At the end he explained how his talk showed that functional programming is here because it is necessary, the challenges we have can&#39;t be tackled without it.</p>
<h2 id="oh-it-s-reactive-may-i-touch-it-">Oh! It&#39;s reactive! May I touch it?</h2>
<p>The closing talk by <em>Dave Thomas</em>. The talk was entertaining with some pretty funny moments. </p>
<p>He made a good summary of the previous talks and raised some relevant issues around current technologies (like UI). He also pointed back to the origin of Actors and how all this has been done before, we have a lot to learn from previous research in the area.</p>
<h2 id="scalable-trait-reactive-supply-to-changing-demand">Scalable Trait - Reactive Supply to Changing Demand</h2>
<p>A talk by <em>Jonas Bon√©r</em> (@jboner). It focussed on scalability and it had a bit of overlap with <em>Martin Thompson</em> talk at the start.</p>
<p>An interesting part of the talk was his discussion on consistency, CAP theorem and share nothing. You could also see how he has been a key person shaping Akka, as his ideas (from an abstract point of view) are most, if not all, implemented in Akka.</p>
<h2 id="event-driven-the-only-way-it-s-gonna-fly-">Event-Driven - The Only Way (It‚Äôs Gonna) Fly!</h2>
<p>The last talk of the first day, by <em>Todd L. Montgomery</em> (@toddlmontgomery). </p>
<p>The talk had a strong focus on state machines and protocols, which was good to understand limitations and why the reactive way is superior. A particularly interesting point was the evolution of REST from request-response to the future HTTP 2.0 based implementations. Lots of goodness coming soon to our web apps :)</p>
<h2 id="reactive-data-management">Reactive Data Management</h2>
<p>A talk by *Andrew Stewart. He focussed on working with data, as that&#39;s the main issue his company, a forex platform, has.</p>
<p>For me the most relevant point of his talk was about the importance of measuring things and how crucial it may be to include that into your design, otherwise it may be too late or too costly. His explanation on different life stages of data was ok, but I felt it was too coupled to his own business, not something that applies generally. Some parts can be relevant for many people, others can be a bit less.</p>
<h2 id="event-driven-user-interfaces">Event Driven User Interfaces</h2>
<p>By <em>Lee Campbell</em> and <em>Matt Barrett</em>, it was basically a demo of their own application.</p>
<p>It raised interesting issues on working with UI in a reactive style, but it was a bit too long due to the &#39;demo&#39; factor. </p>
<h2 id="querying-event-streams-for-fun-and-profit">Querying Event Streams For Fun and Profit</h2>
<p>By <em>Greg Young</em> (@gregyoung). It seemed an interesting talk at the beginning but somehow it become very hard to focus on the topic he was talking about. Unfortunately I can&#39;t point towards a single issue that caused that feeling, but it was the less enjoyable talk of the event.</p>
<h2 id="event-main-points">Event Main Points</h2>
<p>Across all talks there were some underlying themes that seemed to appear over and over across talks. The list is not complete, but some of the main ideas I took from the event are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share nothing. Architecture that isolates data performs better, behaves better, is easier to work with. Just do it.</li>
<li>Internet of things is coming and will force a revolution on software architecture. Maybe you don&#39;t expect your website to be used in a fridge, but the potential increase in connections to an endpoint, and the magnitude of that increase, means we need to change our mindset.  </li>
<li>Currently, actor plus Rx libraries seem to be our best bet to have decent code</li>
<li>Monitoring is becoming more and more important, at the same level (or greater) than unit testing</li>
<li>Law of leaky abstractions is real, and forces you to know the details. Physics, protocols, GC pauses... reactive is more than just using a library.</li>
<li>Graceful degradation had become a core concept. Your app can&#39;t show an error to the user, it must work as well as it can with both data and resources available. </li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#39;s it. As mentioned, this is purely my personal opinion. Some people may like other talks more, my recommendation is to watch <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/reactconf/videos">the videos</a> and, seriously, do your best to attend the conference next year. It is worth it.</p>
